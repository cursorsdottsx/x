# @cursorsdottsx/x

### Welcome to the most cursed JavaScript library's homepage.

This is a collection of the wildest JavaScript fantasies I have dreamed of manifested into a single file 
you can include in your code, so you too, can experience what radical and extreme ideas I have.

In here contains some of the most cursed, most illegal, most what-the-fuck code you will have ever seen in your career.

Be prepared for what's in store because once you open that file there's no going back.

### How to commit a cardinal sin

#### Installation

Don't worry, we offer several methods of adding this to your code.

```bash
npm install @cursorsdottsx/x
```

```bash
yarn add @cursorsdottsx/x
```

```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/cursorsdottsx/x
```

#### Usage

Oh yeah, it's also pretty easy to use.

```js
require("@cursorsdottsx/x");
```

```js
import "@cursorsdottsx/x";
```

If you installed it with `git clone`, put the path to the `index.js` file instead of `@cursorsdottsx/x`.
